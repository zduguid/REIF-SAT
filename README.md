# REIF-SAT

The goal of the Rectangular Earth-Imaging Fast-Spinning Aperture Telescope (REIF-SAT) project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a spinning-aperture space telescope that is capable of achieving high resolution images. REIF-SAT is the deliverable of MIT's Aerospace Engineering capstone course: 16.83 - Space Systems Engineering. In order to demonstrate the feasiblity of a spinning-aperture space telescope, we must develop image processing algorithms that can combine a series of frames into a final synthesized image.
